## Radio Scheduler Simulator
A small personal project for learning C++ and experimenting with development and radio algorithm design.

## About

This repository contains code and experiments created as I learn C++ and explore algorithms related to radio scheduling and related problems. The focus is on hands-on learning, prototyping ideas, and improving engineering practices over time.

## Goals
* Learn and apply modern C++ idioms and tooling.
* Prototype radio scheduling algorithms.
* Keep experiments reproducible and easy to iterate on.
