## Radio Scheduler Simulator
My first C++ program, a small personal project that I used to learn C++ basics and also understand how radio schedulers work in cellular systems (LTE/NR) at a high level.

## About

This project was written as a learning exercise, with the goal of applying C++ programming to a topic I find interesting, this being how wireless schedulers operate at the MAC layer. In short the program is a simulator that runs in discrete time steps and models multiple user devices being scheduled by a base station.

## C++ Learning
Through this project I learned and practiced:
* Writing a basic C++ program structure (main, headers, source files)
* Using struct to model state (users, HARQ, channel state)
* Working with std::vector
* Writing for loops and iterating over containers
* Splitting code into .h and .cpp files
* Passing objects by reference
* Using functions to separate logic
* Using standard library
